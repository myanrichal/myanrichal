      "description": "Great ideas enter into reality with evil associates and with disgusting alliances. (Alfred North Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas.) A degree in engineering is not enough to truly be a creator.  Philosophy was my pursuit for more; challenging my most foundational faiths, analyzing the little bits of nothing that form everything. Exploring what makes me different from the computers I create."
